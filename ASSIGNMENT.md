# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> One of the aspects of the modules code that made it easy to understand was the overall layout. The module code was split into different sections based on what each method did making it easy t ounderstand which methods were related and which methods relied on another method. Of course, the source code to this module had little to no comments anywhere in the file making it much more difficult to understand the exact relationship between methods and what they passed between eachother. The obvious fix to this would be to add commenting to the source code which was done during this excercise. Overall the module was not too difficult to learn because the code was written in a clean manor and was organized well.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> By raising the level of abstraction, it makes it easier for another programmer to come in and use that code without needing to understand all what's under the hood before using it. This is the idea behind what makes an API or a library useful. If the API is able to make the process easier and more simplified, then it is successful. If I had to tell a 142 student how to write an effective comment, in the case of a method, I would tell them the comment needs to tell me what the method needs and what it will give back in return. Therefore, note down the parameters and what their expected types and also the return value and it's type. The goal of a comment is to make the code easier to use by someone else. To simplify the process.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took 4 hours to complete


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> No


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I did not encounter any problems with the assignment. As a future assignment, maybe have a basic programming assignment where we use a node module
  and comment our own code. That way, we will need to understand the node module and learn how it works but also not have to search npm for a simple
  module. It just felt odd going from a coding assignment back to an assignment about commenting.
